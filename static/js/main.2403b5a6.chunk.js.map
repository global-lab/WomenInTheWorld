engineering and technology into the elementary curriculum. IQP students worked in both the Midland Street and Flagg Street Schools. Between the schools there were a total of five classrooms with two IQP students working within each school. Each school and set of IQP students were overseen by a graduate fellow, and the entire third grade team was supervised by a faculty advisor. Through the tools of questioning, group work, and hands-on learning, engineering lessons were designed to be implemented into the classrooms. Over the course of the project year seventeen engineering lessons were created. Of these seventeen lessons ten were implemented, five at Flagg Street School and five at Midland Street School. The main focus of the lessons was to incorporate the five Worcester Public School engineering and technology benchmarks. These benchmarks cover the material students will be tested on in future Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System testing. The lessons implemented in both schools covered four out of the five engineering and technology benchmarks. Another goal of this project was to raise the interest and enthusiasm of minorities and females in engineering and technology. The success of this project was measured by the enthusiasm displayed by both the students and the teachers. This project will be concluded in the next and final year of the grant through an adaptation/sustainability team. This will prov[ide] teachers with the knowledge of engineering to continue this program beyond the life of the NSF grant.\",\r\n        \"FullTextUrl\": \"http://ezproxy.wpi.edu/login?url=http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Scanned/05D200I.pdf\",\r\n        \"ProjectCenter_x\": \"\",\r\n        \"Location_x\": \"Worcester, Massachusetts\",\r\n        \"Creator\": \"Vitale, Daniel F.| Ebersole, Garrett P.| Shaffer, Jeanne Angela| Strum, Lindsey Marie\",\r\n        \"Advisors_x\": \"Fofana, Mustapha S.\",\r\n        \"Sponsor\": \"National Science Foundation (NSF)\",\r\n        \"Date\": \"5-Jan\",\r\n        \"ProjectCenter_y\": \"On-Campus\",\r\n        \"Location_y\": \"Worcester, MA\",\r\n        \"SubjectTerms\": \"Engineering--Study and teaching | Women engineers--education\",\r\n        \"Link\": \"https://digitalcommons.wpi.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5150&context=iqp-all\",\r\n        \"Advisors_y\": \"Fofana, Mustapha S.\",\r\n        \"Initials\": \"CS\",\r\n        \"Notes\": \"Lesson plans in appendices; doesn't really talk about females\",\r\n        \"LinkToSummary\": \"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kQrETvG1j7PPP9nQJhhfqqjOirVXq8gnMs6BTwbvIbE/edit?usp=sharing\",\r\n        \"Goal\": \"To develop lessons for engineering, work with the teachers to implement the lessons and evaluate the impact of the lessons\",\r\n        \"Stakeholders\": \"Worcester public school students\",\r\n        \"Impact\": \"Developed engineering curriculum that the students enjoyed\",\r\n        \"Headline\": \"3rd grade engineering and tech curriculum\",\r\n        \"Follow-up\": \"\",\r\n        \"Category\": \"Education- STEM\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"Clickable Link\": \"http://ezproxy.wpi.edu/login?url=http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Scanned/06E047I.pdf\",\r\n        \"Identifier\": \"06E047I\",\r\n        \"Title\": \"A Future Scientists and Engineers Club for Doherty HS -- a pilot project\",\r\n        \"DateCreated\": \"1/1/2006\",\r\n        \"ProjectType\": \"IQP\",\r\n        \"Availability\": \"Restricted\",\r\n        \"Abstract\": \"A Future Scientist and Engineers after school club program was designed to assist students of Doherty High School achieve their aspirations.

The striking success of the program in attracting females who wanted to explore the possibilities in a technical career without making the commitment necessary to be part of the Engineering and Technology Academy at Doherty is noted.

The Tukey statistical test of the difference of the means for multiple populations was used to conduct our analysis on both the course performance and attitudinal survey data. Student performance was assessed by comparison of exam and final course grade data from courses taught first without and then with bridging. The analysis of the bridge from Calculus III to Introduction to Programming in C shows that students who were bridged performed significantly better on exams in the bridged-to courses in the bridged year. The results of the bridge from Calculus III to Chemistry III showed no significant increase in student performance. The Linear Algebra bridge to students' majors demonstrated significant improvements in students' performance on the final exam. The data shows no significant decline in performance of the students in any population. The students' attitudes were assessed using the Pittsburgh Engineering Attitude Survey. The survey was administered to students before the fall semester and after the spring semester of the freshman year to assess attitude changes after a year of coursework which may have included bridging. The survey results demonstrated increases in bridged students' self-confidence in their problem solving and basic engineering  knowledge and skills. Bridged female students showed a positive change in their impression of engineering. Non-bridged students did not show any significant attitude change. We believe that our results demonstrate that the bridging model is a viable and worthwhile format for course development. The format seems to offer students a way to learn material more in depth without detracting from their learning.

This detriment means that, as the number of jobs in the engineering industries grows, women will not have an equal presence in these fields. Equal female presence in engineering would allow for more diverse engineering practices, increased economic security for women, and reduced need for social welfare. Studies have revealed several reasons for the apparent lack of women in engineering pertaining to childhood development, educational contexts, and gender inclusive opportunities in the industry. In the attempt to correct the problem diverse solutions have been researched and implemented. One such solution is the implementation of summer camps and outreach programs. WPI in its effort to contribute to the solution has developed several summer camps including Camp Reach (CR). CR program provides a variety of activities that strive to affect issues of childhood development and educational contexts. Activities in the camp focus on workshops presenting numerous engineering disciplines. The goal of this Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP) is to improve the workshop component at CR. Through consideration of the above this project presents the Oil Rig workshop that was developed and tested, along with a list of recommendations for future implementation.\",\r\n        \"FullTextUrl\": \"http://ezproxy.wpi.edu/login?url=http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Scanned/04B002I.pdf\",\r\n        \"ProjectCenter_x\": \"\",\r\n        \"Location_x\": \"Worcester, Massachusetts\",\r\n        \"Creator\": \"Levshin, Alexandra A.| Stanley, Dawn M.| Tisdell, Geoffrey P.| Gouverneur, Irene M.\",\r\n        \"Advisors_x\": \"Demetry, Chrysanthe | Blaisdell, Stephanie\",\r\n        \"Sponsor\": \"\",\r\n        \"Date\": \"1/1/2004\",\r\n        \"ProjectCenter_y\": \"On-Campus\",\r\n        \"Location_y\": \"Worcester, MA\",\r\n        \"SubjectTerms\": \"Women Engineers--Education| Women\",\r\n        \"Link\": \"http://ezproxy.wpi.edu/login?url=http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Scanned/04B002I.pdf\",\r\n        \"Advisors_y\": \"Demetry, Chrysanthe | Blaisdell, Stephanie\",\r\n        \"Initials\": \"CS\",\r\n        \"Notes\": \"\",\r\n        \"LinkToSummary\": \"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vochIITtYJUoWzve5HbW-nHnbu6MRV4y5Nl6jFaxhGo/edit?usp=sharing\",\r\n        \"Goal\": \"To improve the workshop component at Camp REACH\",\r\n        \"Stakeholders\": \"Girls at Camp REACH, WPI\",\r\n        \"Impact\": \"Emphasized the need for more interaction and less discussion for the girls\",\r\n        \"Headline\": \"\",\r\n        \"Follow-up\": \"\",\r\n        \"Category\": \"Education- STEM\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"Clickable Link\": \"http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-050115-041054/unrestricted/WPI_Enrollment_of_Female_Engineers_2015.pdf\",\r\n        \"Identifier\": \"E-project-050115-041054\",\r\n        \"Title\": \"Improving Enrollment of Female Engineers at NTB\",\r\n        \"DateCreated\": \"5/1/2015\",\r\n        \"ProjectType\": \"IQP\",\r\n        \"Availability\": \"unrestricted\",\r\n        \"Abstract\": \"This project contributed to the global effort to recruit women into STEM fields, focusing on Switzerland.

Our goal was to encourage students to take an interest in science and technology and consider this as a career option. It fell to us to start the actual club as the prior team focused on planning and getting the necessary permissions as well as recruiting an advisor on the HS faculty. The Club idea was inspired by the results of an aspirations survey of  Worcester high school juniors -- especially when they are compared to data collected from 8th graders in the same city. Both gender imbalance and the decline of the number of students interested in technical subjects and careers by 11th grade were of concern. It is of particular concern to the sponsor (Advisory Committee on the Status of Women) to support female students with technical interests since women are underrepresented in the technical fields. The North High Club project took place in a high school with a special program devoted to health careers. A similar program devoted to engineering careers was in another high school in another part of the city. The project was declared a success by the student participants, who responded to a survey, and the high school faculty advisors. We also consider it a success, but more for the potential it revealed and the  promising start made than what was actually achieved this year. The need for technically oriented sophomores to get some kind of help as they plan their junior year's schedules and consider the possibility of college, especially a technical college, is pressing. The impact that a simple one day field trip to WPI had, just to look around and ask questions, was astounding. A Club like this could become a major in-school resource for students who want to try on the idea of a technical career for size, without making any serious commitment. It also countered prevailing stereotypes about engineers fairly well and disproportionately attracted attention from females. Role models our age seem to have considerable credibility with this age group and our  encouragement and willingness to answer questions, some of which were very basic, seemed to matter a great deal.\",\r\n        \"FullTextUrl\": \"http://ezproxy.wpi.edu/login?url=http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Scanned/07E030I.pdf\",\r\n        \"ProjectCenter_x\": \"\",\r\n        \"Location_x\": \"Worcester, Massachusetts\",\r\n        \"Creator\": \"Ngo, Alan| Souza, Timothy J\",\r\n        \"Advisors_x\": \"Wilkes, John M.\",\r\n        \"Sponsor\": \"North High School\",\r\n        \"Date\": \"1/1/2007\",\r\n        \"ProjectCenter_y\": \"On-Campus\",\r\n        \"Location_y\": \"Worcester, MA\",\r\n        \"SubjectTerms\": \"Science--Study and teaching|Engineering--Study and teaching|Mathematics--Study and teaching\",\r\n        \"Link\": \"http://ezproxy.wpi.edu/login?url=http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Scanned/07E030I.pdf\",\r\n        \"Advisors_y\": \"Wilkes, John M.\",\r\n        \"Initials\": \"AN\",\r\n        \"Notes\": \"\",\r\n        \"LinkToSummary\": \"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QYxXtV7rqLKgkbd4IwHdsdB6ruDtmyXMdRXMLXmggLk/edit?usp=sharing\",\r\n        \"Goal\": \"To encourage students to take an interest in science and technology and consider this as a career option\",\r\n        \"Stakeholders\": \"Students, esp. female students pursuing STEM\",\r\n        \"Impact\": \"Had a diverse club in terms of race, gender, and career interests\",\r\n        \"Headline\": \"\",\r\n        \"Follow-up\": \"\",\r\n        \"Category\": \"Education- STEM\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"Clickable Link\": \"http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-101808-001337/unrestricted/IQP_Pagano_Swahn_Final.pdf\",\r\n        \"Identifier\": \"E-project-101808-001337\",\r\n        \"Title\": \"North High School: Gender Equity Study\",\r\n        \"DateCreated\": \"10/18/2008\",\r\n        \"ProjectType\": \"IQP\",\r\n        \"Availability\": \"unrestricted\",\r\n        \"Abstract\": \"In the current study, we examined the attitudes students had towards science and investigated whether we could improve attitudes toward science by exposing students to engaging activities towards different areas of science.

The legalization of RU486 in the United States has been such an extensive process due to contention from pro-life advocates. The reasons people oppose RU486 are the same reasons why they generally oppose abortion. RU486 is a pill that causes a non-surgical abortion, but is not yet legal in the United States. Many women in society who are looking for different abortion methods are uninformed about RU486 or other abortion methods. Using the most popular information medium today, the facts and opinions will be accessible to help inform individuals about different abortion methods and abortion politics. Through the use of interviews, books, magazine articles, and web pages, an educational web page about this pill and other abortion techniques will be created. By conducting interviews with representatives of organizations from two sides of the abortion debate, a more effective and informative representation of the pro-life or pro-choice organizations can be shown. The data collected from these interviews will serve as a support for the background information researched. Using the responses received from the interviews to reinforce the findings of the research, led to a conclusion that there are three major issues evident in this debate. These issues were common in the interview findings and the research. The first issue is the status of the embryo. The second issue is that the debate is not about data, but rather how to assess the data. Finally, the third issue is the role of a person in society. The purpose of this web page is to illustrate the political and technical aspects of RU486 and the abortion debate in an unbiased form, thus providing readers with the necessary information about RU486 and abortion to make educated decisions.\",\r\n        \"FullTextUrl\": \"http://ezproxy.wpi.edu/login?url=http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Scanned/99D324I.pdf\",\r\n        \"ProjectCenter_x\": \"\",\r\n        \"Location_x\": \"Worcester, Massachusetts\",\r\n        \"Creator\": \"Schrecke, Gregory Scott| Dominguez, Luigi\",\r\n        \"Advisors_x\": \"Jamison, Wesley V.\",\r\n        \"Sponsor\": \"\",\r\n        \"Date\": \"1/1/1999\",\r\n        \"ProjectCenter_y\": \"On-Campus\",\r\n        \"Location_y\": \"Worcester, MA\",\r\n        \"SubjectTerms\": \"Women--Health\",\r\n        \"Link\": \"http://ezproxy.wpi.edu/login?url=http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Scanned/99D324I.pdf\",\r\n        \"Advisors_y\": \"Jamison, Wesley V.\",\r\n        \"Initials\": \"AN\",\r\n        \"Notes\": \"\",\r\n        \"LinkToSummary\": \"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rg-jBT7-QocWK2tYl-dkdhMrkjMOpEzzHYIjzQhU52I/edit?usp=sharing\",\r\n        \"Goal\": \"To develop an educational web page with info about RU486 and other abortion techniques (including procedural) and the pros and cons of each technique\",\r\n        \"Stakeholders\": \"Women\",\r\n        \"Impact\": \"Listed three main issues to the abortion debate: status of the embryo, how to access facts surrounding the issue, and the debate about abortion is actually a debate about the role of a person\",\r\n        \"Headline\": \"\",\r\n        \"Follow-up\": \"\",\r\n        \"Category\": \"Health\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"Clickable Link\": \"http://ezproxy.wpi.edu/login?url=http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Scanned/06E025I.pdf\",\r\n        \"Identifier\": \"06E025I\",\r\n        \"Title\": \"Social programming at Worcester Polytechnic Institute\",\r\n        \"DateCreated\": \"1/1/2006\",\r\n        \"ProjectType\": \"IQP\",\r\n        \"Availability\": \"Restricted\",\r\n        \"Abstract\": \"This project studies the social programming structure at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

The results suggested that females were much more interested in the professions than the males, but focused on law and medicine. The technical professions remained male domains, and teaching and social services female domains. Interest in business careers was approaching a 50/50 balance. Gender was a far more important predictor of career aspirations in the private/parochial schools than in the private/secular and public schools. Still, the overall finding was that the data from the public and private schools was quite similar, surprisingly so. The implications of these trends and findings were sufficiently great that the ACSW sponsored three more teams this year to see if these findings would replicate. The private school study teams decided to expand their studies by adding a new variable, gender identity (masculine or feminine as culturally defined), operationalized by Sandra Bern. This is the report of the private high school replication study, augmented by the new Bern Sex Role Inventory variable. In the main, the pattern of career aspiration findings from last year have replicated. In addition, we now know that it is the surprisingly large minority group of masculine identity females (twice the size of feminine identity males) that is the vanguard of progress toward gender equity in still primarily male fields. What is special about medicine and law is the shift in aspirations of large numbers of feminine identity females to enter into these fields as well. The social definition of these fields seems to have changed -- at least as the oncoming generation of students now in high school see them.

Among females, the feeling students had an advantage on the SAT.  When the SAT was divided into ranges sought by and typical of the more selective colleges, it was clear that the differences by these MBTI variables were large enough to be of practical significance in terms of college admission.  These differences in cognitive distribution sometimes appear in odd ways. For example, two of the four high schools in Worcester have significantly higher percentages of intuitives than the other two schools.  Furthermore, the minority population had lower SAT scores which may may partly be explained by the differences in sensing and intuition by ethhnic distribution in Worcester.\",\r\n        \"FullTextUrl\": \"http://ezproxy.wpi.edu/login?url=http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Scanned/03D147I.pdf\",\r\n        \"ProjectCenter_x\": \"\",\r\n        \"Location_x\": \"Worcester, Massachusetts\",\r\n        \"Creator\": \"Mentz, Brian Craig| Jeffers, Sara Alyson\",\r\n        \"Advisors_x\": \"Wilkes, John M.\",\r\n        \"Sponsor\": \"\",\r\n        \"Date\": \"3-Jan\",\r\n        \"ProjectCenter_y\": \"On-Campus\",\r\n        \"Location_y\": \"Worcester, MA\",\r\n        \"SubjectTerms\": \"Personality and intelligence\",\r\n        \"Link\": \"https://digitalcommons.wpi.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6067&context=iqp-all\",\r\n        \"Advisors_y\": \"Wilkes, John M.\",\r\n        \"Initials\": \"CS\",\r\n        \"Notes\": \"Gender was just one component of the analysis\",\r\n        \"LinkToSummary\": \"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Aszsct3JgVweKanyF8CLWoV3fytrjn2vPIUL8lSzmfE/edit?usp=sharing\",\r\n        \"Goal\": \"To develop a procedure to compare cognitive type, grades, SAT scores, and college placement\",\r\n        \"Stakeholders\": \"Students at Worcester Public Schools, Worcester State College\",\r\n        \"Impact\": \"The common personality type of minorities predicted they would do worse on the SATs\",\r\n        \"Headline\": \"Gender components in standardized tests\",\r\n        \"Follow-up\": \"\",\r\n        \"Category\": \"Education\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"Clickable Link\": \"http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-031411-124623/unrestricted/AMotzer_KRondina_Project.pdf\",\r\n        \"Identifier\": \"E-project-031411-124623\",\r\n        \"Title\": \"We Don?t Agree, But We?re Working Together: Examining How Affiliative Motivation and Perspective Taking Effect Social Tuning\",\r\n        \"DateCreated\": \"3/14/2011\",\r\n        \"ProjectType\": \"IQP\",\r\n        \"Availability\": \"unrestricted\",\r\n        \"Abstract\": \"The present study examined the role of affiliative motivation and perspective taking on social tuning.
