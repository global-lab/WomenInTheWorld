IQP students worked in both the Midland Street and Flagg Street Schools. Between the schools there were a total of five classrooms with two IQP students working within each school. Each school and set of IQP students were overseen by a graduate fellow, and the entire third grade team was supervised by a faculty advisor. Through the tools of questioning, group work, and hands-on learning, engineering lessons were designed to be implemented into the classrooms. Over the course of the project year seventeen engineering lessons were created. Of these seventeen lessons ten were implemented, five at Flagg Street School and five at Midland Street School. The main focus of the lessons was to incorporate the five Worcester Public School engineering and technology benchmarks. These benchmarks cover the material students will be tested on in future Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System testing. The lessons implemented in both schools covered four out of the five engineering and technology benchmarks. Another goal of this project was to raise the interest and enthusiasm of minorities and females in engineering and technology. The success of this project was measured by the enthusiasm displayed by both the students and the teachers. This project will be concluded in the next and final year of the grant through an adaptation/sustainability team.

This study assessed the effectiveness of the \"bridging model\" based on students' performance in courses and change in students' attitudes towards engineering and science. The Tukey statistical test of the difference of the means for multiple populations was used to conduct our analysis on both the course performance and attitudinal survey data. Student performance was assessed by comparison of exam and final course grade data from courses taught first without and then with bridging. The analysis of the bridge from Calculus III to Introduction to Programming in C shows that students who were bridged performed significantly better on exams in the bridged-to courses in the bridged year. The results of the bridge from Calculus III to Chemistry III showed no significant increase in student performance. The Linear Algebra bridge to students' majors demonstrated significant improvements in students' performance on the final exam. The data shows no significant decline in performance of the students in any population. The students' attitudes were assessed using the Pittsburgh Engineering Attitude Survey. The survey was administered to students before the fall semester and after the spring semester of the freshman year to assess attitude changes after a year of coursework which may have included bridging. The survey results demonstrated increases in bridged students' self-confidence in their problem solving and basic engineering  knowledge and skills. Bridged female students showed a positive change in their impression of engineering. Non-bridged students did not show any significant attitude change. We believe that our results demonstrate that the bridging model is a viable and worthwhile format for course development.

This detriment means that, as the number of jobs in the engineering industries grows, women will not have an equal presence in these fields.

Studies have revealed several reasons for the apparent lack of women in engineering pertaining to childhood development, educational contexts, and gender inclusive opportunities in the industry. In the attempt to correct the problem diverse solutions have been researched and implemented. One such solution is the implementation of summer camps and outreach programs. WPI in its effort to contribute to the solution has developed several summer camps including Camp Reach (CR). CR program provides a variety of activities that strive to affect issues of childhood development and educational contexts.

Our goal was to encourage students to take an interest in science and technology and consider this as a career option. It fell to us to start the actual club as the prior team focused on planning and getting the necessary permissions as well as recruiting an advisor on the HS faculty. The Club idea was inspired by the results of an aspirations survey of  Worcester high school juniors -- especially when they are compared to data collected from 8th graders in the same city. Both gender imbalance and the decline of the number of students interested in technical subjects and careers by 11th grade were of concern. It is of particular concern to the sponsor (Advisory Committee on the Status of Women) to support female students with technical interests since women are underrepresented in the technical fields. The North High Club project took place in a high school with a special program devoted to health careers. A similar program devoted to engineering careers was in another high school in another part of the city. The project was declared a success by the student participants, who responded to a survey, and the high school faculty advisors. We also consider it a success, but more for the potential it revealed and the  promising start made than what was actually achieved this year. The need for technically oriented sophomores to get some kind of help as they plan their junior year's schedules and consider the possibility of college, especially a technical college, is pressing. The impact that a simple one day field trip to WPI had, just to look around and ask questions, was astounding. A Club like this could become a major in-school resource for students who want to try on the idea of a technical career for size, without making any serious commitment. It also countered prevailing stereotypes about engineers fairly well and disproportionately attracted attention from females. Role models our age seem to have considerable credibility with this age group and our  encouragement and willingness to answer questions, some of which were very basic, seemed to matter a great deal.",FullTextUrl:"http://ezproxy.wpi.edu/login?url=http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Scanned/07E030I.pdf",ProjectCenter_x:"",Location_x:"Worcester, Massachusetts",Creator:"Ngo, Alan| Souza, Timothy J",Advisors_x:"Wilkes, John M.",Sponsor:"North High School",Date:"1/1/2007",ProjectCenter_y:"On-Campus",Location_y:"Worcester, MA",SubjectTerms:"Science--Study and teaching|Engineering--Study and teaching|Mathematics--Study and teaching",Link:"http://ezproxy.wpi.edu/login?url=http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Scanned/07E030I.pdf",Advisors_y:"Wilkes, John M.",Initials:"AN",Notes:"",LinkToSummary:"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QYxXtV7rqLKgkbd4IwHdsdB6ruDtmyXMdRXMLXmggLk/edit?usp=sharing",Goal:"To encourage students to take an interest in science and technology and consider this as a career option",Stakeholders:"Students, esp. female students pursuing STEM",Impact:"Had a diverse club in terms of race, gender, and career interests",Headline:"","Follow-up":"",Category:"Education- STEM"},{"Clickable Link":"http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-101808-001337/unrestricted/IQP_Pagano_Swahn_Final.pdf",Identifier:"E-project-101808-001337",Title:"North High School: Gender Equity Study",DateCreated:"10/18/2008",ProjectType:"IQP",Availability:"unrestricted",Abstract:"In the current study, we examined the attitudes students had towards science and investigated whether we could improve attitudes toward science by exposing students to engaging activities towards different areas of science.

The legalization of RU486 in the United States has been such an extensive process due to contention from pro-life advocates. The reasons people oppose RU486 are the same reasons why they generally oppose abortion. RU486 is a pill that causes a non-surgical abortion, but is not yet legal in the United States. Many women in society who are looking for different abortion methods are uninformed about RU486 or other abortion methods. Using the most popular information medium today, the facts and opinions will be accessible to help inform individuals about different abortion methods and abortion politics. Through the use of interviews, books, magazine articles, and web pages, an educational web page about this pill and other abortion techniques will be created. By conducting interviews with representatives of organizations from two sides of the abortion debate, a more effective and informative representation of the pro-life or pro-choice organizations can be shown. The data collected from these interviews will serve as a support for the background information researched. Using the responses received from the interviews to reinforce the findings of the research, led to a conclusion that there are three major issues evident in this debate. These issues were common in the interview findings and the research. The first issue is the status of the embryo. The second issue is that the debate is not about data, but rather how to assess the data. Finally, the third issue is the role of a person in society. The purpose of this web page is to illustrate the political and technical aspects of RU486 and the abortion debate in an unbiased form, thus providing readers with the necessary information about RU486 and abortion to make educated decisions.",FullTextUrl:"http://ezproxy.wpi.edu/login?url=http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Scanned/99D324I.pdf",ProjectCenter_x:"",Location_x:"Worcester, Massachusetts",Creator:"Schrecke, Gregory Scott| Dominguez, Luigi",Advisors_x:"Jamison, Wesley V.",Sponsor:"",Date:"1/1/1999",ProjectCenter_y:"On-Campus",Location_y:"Worcester, MA",SubjectTerms:"Women--Health",Link:"http://ezproxy.wpi.edu/login?url=http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Scanned/99D324I.pdf",Advisors_y:"Jamison, Wesley V.",Initials:"AN",Notes:"",LinkToSummary:"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rg-jBT7-QocWK2tYl-dkdhMrkjMOpEzzHYIjzQhU52I/edit?usp=sharing",Goal:"To develop an educational web page with info about RU486 and other abortion techniques (including procedural) and the pros and cons of each technique",Stakeholders:"Women",Impact:"Listed three main issues to the abortion debate: status of the embryo, how to access facts surrounding the issue, and the debate about abortion is actually a debate about the role of a person",Headline:"","Follow-up":"",Category:"Health"},{"Clickable Link":"http://ezproxy.wpi.edu/login?url=http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Scanned/06E025I.pdf",Identifier:"06E025I",Title:"Social programming at Worcester Polytechnic Institute",DateCreated:"1/1/2006",ProjectType:"IQP",Availability:"Restricted",Abstract:"This project studies the social programming structure at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

The results suggested that females were much more interested in the professions than the males, but focused on law and medicine. The technical professions remained male domains, and teaching and social services female domains. Interest in business careers was approaching a 50/50 balance. Gender was a far more important predictor of career aspirations in the private/parochial schools than in the private/secular and public schools. Still, the overall finding was that the data from the public and private schools was quite similar, surprisingly so. The implications of these trends and findings were sufficiently great that the ACSW sponsored three more teams this year to see if these findings would replicate. The private school study teams decided to expand their studies by adding a new variable, gender identity (masculine or feminine as culturally defined), operationalized by Sandra Bern. This is the report of the private high school replication study, augmented by the new Bern Sex Role Inventory variable. In the main, the pattern of career aspiration findings from last year have replicated. In addition, we now know that it is the surprisingly large minority group of masculine identity females (twice the size of feminine identity males) that is the vanguard of progress toward gender equity in still primarily male fields. What is special about medicine and law is the shift in aspirations of large numbers of feminine identity females to enter into these fields as well. The social definition of these fields seems to have changed -- at least as the oncoming generation of students now in high school see them. It is what they think that matters most in terms of gender equity in the professions a decade or two from now.",FullTextUrl:"http://ezproxy.wpi.edu/login?url=http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Scanned/07D067I.pdf",ProjectCenter_x:"",Location_x:"Worcester, Massachusetts",Creator:"Kazinik, Yekaterina",Advisors_x:"Wilkes, John M.",Sponsor:"Advisory Committee on the Status of Women (ACSW)",Date:"1/1/2007",ProjectCenter_y:"On-Campus",Location_y:"Worcester, MA",SubjectTerms:"Women in engineering | Women in science",Link:"http://ezproxy.wpi.edu/login?url=http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Scanned/07D067I.pdf",Advisors_y:"Wilkes, John M.",Initials:"AN",Notes:"",LinkToSummary:"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rOVPui_V8i5zfW_XdVjuRiBp_zjz_lkNinAWEBqscxE/edit?usp=sharing",Goal:"To determine what impact the sex ratio at four different parochial high schools ranging from all male to all female students was on career aspirations",Stakeholders:"Worcester private/parochial high school students",Impact:"Results replicated from the original private/charter school career aspirations study (Original 2005 study: https://docs.google.com/document/d/15e8kiUtgGNFnx-hJ44taTO1sZuSg4q-tbgfjub_VN0I/edit?usp=sharing)",Headline:"","Follow-up":"",Category:"Education"},{"Clickable Link":"http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-022808-000103/unrestricted/2008BeaversGoodrichKaufman.pdf",Identifier:"E-project-022808-000103",Title:"The Effect of an Educational Video on the Acceptance of Nanotechnology",DateCreated:"2/28/2008",ProjectType:"IQP",Availability:"unrestricted",Abstract:"The effect of an educational video on the acceptance of nanotechnology was studied using an internet based system to collect data.

Additionally, brand prestige, social benefits, distinctiveness, and warmth influence wine purchasing preferences more generally. New producers should market their distinct identities (black, female) as they reveal warmth and familiarity to certain consumer segments, and can drive brand distinctiveness.",FullTextUrl:"http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-121417-094228/unrestricted/WIW_Final_IQP_Report_B17.pdf",ProjectCenter_x:"Cape Town, South Africa Project Center - IQP",Location_x:"",Creator:"Bovich, David| Kruzan, Derek Albert| Payano, Jennifer A.| Lewis, Rose Elizabeth",Advisors_x:"Bulled, Nicola| Skorinko, Jeanine L.",Sponsor:"Women in Wine | Farmer, Beverly",Date:"12/14/2017",ProjectCenter_y:"Cape Town, South Africa",Location_y:"Cape Town, South Africa",SubjectTerms:"Marketing | Women entrepreneurs",Link:"http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-121417-094228/unrestricted/WIW_Final_IQP_Report_B17.pdf",Advisors_y:"Bulled, Nicola| Skorinko, Jeanine L.",Initials:"AN",Notes:"Report has lots of visuals",LinkToSummary:"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16KliaMj4GcR-g7bHnovvxe5VVX4VTXw9VQIhgkVfBWg/edit?usp=sharing",Goal:"To explore the issues of identity with regards to wine consumption in an effort to inform new producers, like our sponsor Women and Wine, how they might consider future brand imagery",Stakeholders:"Underrepresented groups in wine making industry, Women in Wine",Impact:"Found that four key drivers predict consumer-brand identification within the wine industry: brand prestige, brand social benefits, brand distinctiveness, and brand warmth",Headline:"","Follow-up":"",Category:"Business"},{"Clickable Link":"http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-050415-073524/unrestricted/Banksia_Report_Final.pdf",Identifier:"E-project-050415-073524",Title:"Using Technology to Enhance Opportunities in a Disadvantaged Community through Online Advocacy and Computer Education",DateCreated:"5/4/2015",ProjectType:"IQP",Availability:"unrestricted",Abstract:"Banksia Gardens Community Centre is located in the disadvantaged community of Broadmeadows, Victoria.

When the SAT was divided into ranges sought by and typical of the more selective colleges, it was clear that the differences by these MBTI variables were large enough to be of practical significance in terms of college admission.  These differences in cognitive distribution sometimes appear in odd ways.
